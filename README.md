# emdr

Do It Yourself EMDR equipment (lightbar, buzzers and headphones). Firmware and controller app. 

## Hardware

Please watch this [video](https://youtu.be/0NRr-7e_mLk) about the project.

### Light bar

![light bar](artwork/lightbar.jpg)

The invention of LED stripes with ready mounted LED pixels makes the DIY manufacturing of EMDR light bar a piece of cake. :-)

The only electrical component missing from these stripes is an USB connection. This is done by a Teensy microcontroller,
which implements a USB peripheral protocol on the one hand and the WS2812 serial bus on the other. The USB connection
also powers the microcontroller and the LEDs. Fortunately, an EMDR light bar never has more than one LED illuminated
at the same time, so USB current is sufficient.

Wiring is quite simple, since the Teensy LC already has a 5 V driver on board.

### Buzzers

#### Parts list

It would be some act of handcraft to build your own buzzers. It is way easier to purchase some proper erotic device 
called "bullet vibrator" and disassemble the needed parts. 
You just should not tell your clients about the original purpose of these buzzers. ;-)

Again, to connect the buzzers to an USB bus, a Teensy microcontroller is used. Other than with the lightbar you need some
extra electronic components to drive the buzzer motors.

### Controller

![controller](artwork/controller.jpg)

Controller is optional. You can also use a PC or Laptop with MacOS, Windows or Linux to run the controller software.

### Headphones

Sound stimulation is produced by the integrated sound hardware, either of your PC or Raspberry Pi standalone controller.
Just attach an appropriate headphone to the sound jack.

## Software

### Lightbar and buzzers

Easiest way to program the Teensy microcontrollers is to use the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) with
[Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html) extension. You can run this on MacOS, Windows or Linux.
Just start the IDE, load the proper Arduino project file from my repository (subdirectory "firmware"), 
attach the teensy device, press the programming button on the device and the upload button in the IDE. Done.

You can test the device by using the Arduino serial monitor tool. Just send the letter "i". You should receive the
device identifier, either "EMDR Lightbar" or "EMDR Buzzer".

### Controller

#### On PC

Since the controller is a python script, you can run it on any platform supported by pyGame and pyUSB, e.g. Windows,
MacOS or Linux. You have to have Python 3.x installed.

Copy the files from my repository (subdirecotry "controller"), including the "imgs" directory.
Install necessary libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
In order to run the pyUSB library, you also need "libusb" to be installed. Please
see https://github.com/pyusb/pyusb for further instructions.

#### On Raspberry Pi

To set up a standalone controller on a Raspberry Pi, you would have to do some expert work, like installing a
Linux OS on a SD card, install and start the LCD driver for the touchscreen display, istall libusb,
change password, configure for graphical desktop with auto login, download and install the controller software
from my repository and set up the desktop to autostart the controller software after boot.

But fortunately, there is [PiBakery](https://www.pibakery.org/). You can use the "recipe"-File from my repository
(subdirectory "pi") and PiBakery to burn a ready-to-go SD-card. At the very first boot, the Raspberry Pi will download
and install all necessary software. For that, the Pi will have to have internet access. Just attach the Pi to your
local ethernet. After a while, the Pi reboots and shows the controller software. From now on, no network connection
is needed again. You can use the Pi as a simple controller panel for the EMDR equipment.
